# Glitch Polyam Edition

> Mastodon, but better!

This project started as a fork of [glitch-soc](https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon), which itself is a fork of Mastodon, but strives to provide even more features and provide an overall better experience.

## Features

A full list of changes can be found [on the wiki](https://github.com/polyamspace/mastodon/wiki)

### Emoji reactions

Want to give a toot a thumbs up? Show your love with a custom emoji? \
With polyam-glitch you can! \
React to toots with emojis and custom emojis.

### Alt-text modal

Want to read alt-text without awkwardly hovering over an image? \
Click the alt label and read the alt-text in a modal. \
This also works for audio and video attachments.

### Syntax highlighting for code blocks

Code is far easier to read with syntax highlighting. \
So write a code block similar to how you do on GitHub and see your code highlighted.

### Custom notification sounds

Users can choose between notification sounds and admins can add their own. \
No more replacing the default sound file.

### Additional themes

Polyam-glitch comes with 2 additional themes by default: \
Fairy Floss and Homogay.

### Polyam flavour

Polyam-glitch comes with its own flavour based on the glitch flavour. \
All features are available for it.

## Installation and updating

Installation is pretty much the same as upstream. \
Please read the [glitch-soc docs](https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/) for instructions.

Update steps are also the same, but for convenience an update script is available on the [scripts repo](https://github.com/polyamspace/scripts)
